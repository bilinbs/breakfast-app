Rosa's Breakfast Service
------------------------

Rosa has found a company that suplies a complete breakfast delivered to homes of its customers. Customer, can order from one of the breakfast menus on Rosa's website, indicate hour and place of delivery, give their credit card number and the ordered breakfast will be delivered. Rosa's slogan is "Surprise your husband, wife, father, mother or friend on their special day while still enjoying the comfort of your bed".

Rosa has composed a series of breakfast with items served as set by the choice of customers. For instance, if you choose the "French breakfast" you will get 1 cup of coffee, 1 glass of orange juice, 1 roll bread, butter and jam. If you choose "English breakfast", you will get two fried eggs and bacon, 3 peices of toast and a pot of tea. If you choose "Champagne feast" breakfast, you will get a bottle of champagne, a choice of French cheese and a thermos bottle filled with coffee.

Orders can be filled for any number of people. Items served are set, but cutomers can indicate the style in which breakfast is served. They can choose between simple, grand and deluxe. A simple breakfast is served on a plastic tray with carton plates and paper napkins. A grand breakfast is served on a wooden tray with plates and cups ad simple white cotton napkins and glasses made of real glass. A deluxe beakfast is served on a silver tray, with flower vase and the napkins are decorated, made from finest linen. The price of the breakfast is higher when the serving style is better. Some breakfast types like "Champagne feast" can be ordered only in grand or deluxe styles only.

Rosa wants to give her customers a bit of flexibility. Customers, after selecting a standard breakfast as a basis, can decide to put extra castable, alter the amount of certain parts or even remove certain parts.
The ordering system is a standard web based 3-tier application. If the customer agrees, his or her name and address will be input in the system. This will enable Rosa to give a discount to regular customers. The database should hold customer information such as name, price and contents of all types of breakfasts offered and ordering information. Middle tier will primarily add order and customer to the database. 3- tier application should consist of database, business layer and user interface layer.
